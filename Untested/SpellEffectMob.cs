 * This script will take the mob's name, convert it to a
 * spell number, then send that spell animation to all
 * players in it's visibility distance, At a specific
 * interval.  The interval is two seconds.  Game creation
 * command: /mob create DOL.GS.Scripts.SpellEffectMob
 * then do /mob name <number> to set what spell number it
 * should cast on itself.  Then do /mob noname to hide
 * it's name from players.  You might also do want /mob
 * notarget and finally /mob model 1 if you want the mob
 * invisible, so they only see the spell effect.  How to
 * set randomness: /mob guild random will turn randomness
 * on.  Then set the mobs level to how random you want it.
 * Mob level 1 = a 2 in 1 chance (every pulse goes off).
 * Mob level 2 = a 2 in 2 chance (every pulse still goes off),
 * Mob level 3 is a 2 in 3 chance for the pulse to go off.
 * Mob level 4 is a 2 in 4 chance (50% chance) for the pulse
 * to go off.  A Mob level 255 would be a 2 in 255 chance
 * the pulse goes off, if you want to make it very seldom
 * that it goes off.  Experiment with different mob levels
 * to suite your needs. A chance to pulse would happen every
 * 2 seconds, but if it's random it won't pulse every time
 * (unless you set a level of 1, or 2 or turn randomness off)
 * It will pulse if the random number is either a 1 or if the
 * random number = the level of the mob.  You can uncomment
 * the "my random number was" line if you want to see how the
 * randoms work.  I reccommend making a 2nd script with a 10
 * second interval as well because some spell effects are
 * better suited for 10+ seconds inbetween pulses.
 * I've also noticed it helps to move the mob after placing
 * it for the first time to get it to refresh.
 * 
 * To Recap, Set it's name to a spell number, set it's guild
 * to "random" (or "Random" or "RANDOM") if you want random.
 * Set it's level (low number = often, High number = seldom).
 * 
 * Version 2:  added code to keep it from pulsing too much.
 * 
 * Version 3: Now it uses the mob's aggro range for setting the
 * distance at which the effect is visible to the player.
